# Vsd_SquadroMini-internship
-------

The VSDSquadron Mini-Internship program introduces participants to the world of VLSI chip design and RISC-V architecture using open-source tools. It provides a practical, hands-on learning experience centered around the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Board.The development board is equipped with a 32-bit RISC-V core, 16KB of flash memory, and 2KB of SRAM, operating at a clock speed of 24MHz. It features 15 GPIO pins for hardware interfacing and supports widely-used communication protocols such as I2C, SPI, and USART, making it versatile for a range of projects. These capabilities allow participants to build and prototype hardware applications while deepening their understanding of the RISC-V ecosystem.
