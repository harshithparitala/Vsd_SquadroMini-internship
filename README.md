# Vsd_SquadroMini-internship

This VSDSquadron Mini-Internship program introduces participants to the world of VLSI chip design and RISC-V architecture using open-source tools. It provides a practical, hands-on learning experience centered around the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Board.The development board is equipped with a 32-bit RISC-V core, 16KB of flash memory, and 2KB of SRAM, operating at a clock speed of 24MHz. It features 15 GPIO pins for hardware interfacing and supports widely-used communication protocols such as I2C, SPI, and USART, making it versatile for a range of projects. These capabilities allow participants to build and prototype hardware applications while deepening their understanding of the RISC-V ecosystem.

Install leafpad editor for C programming using command
 ``
         sudo apt  install leafpad
 ``
 ![install leafpad](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69a4702e-69e4-494d-8bb0-4a9f347eee5b)

Write a program that gives the sum of n numbers using C in leafpad editor."sum1ton.c" is the filename

 ![overleaf sum1ton](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b683e34-7296-4785-889d-fc1b85038656)

 After Compiling C code save ``ctrl+s'' and close the window ``ctrl+w`` 

 Run the program and check the results using commands
 ````
gcc sum1ton.c
./a.out 
````
./a.out is used for result

result :
