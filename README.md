# Vsd_SquadroMini-internship

This VSDSquadron Mini-Internship program introduces participants to the world of VLSI chip design and RISC-V architecture using open-source tools. It provides a practical, hands-on learning experience centered around the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Board.The development board is equipped with a 32-bit RISC-V core, 16KB of flash memory, and 2KB of SRAM, operating at a clock speed of 24MHz. It features 15 GPIO pins for hardware interfacing and supports widely-used communication protocols such as I2C, SPI, and USART, making it versatile for a range of projects. These capabilities allow participants to build and prototype hardware applications while deepening their understanding of the RISC-V ecosystem.

 C-Based Lab
 ----
Install leafpad editor for C programming using command

 ```
         sudo apt  install leafpad
 ```
 ![install leafpad](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69a4702e-69e4-494d-8bb0-4a9f347eee5b)

Write a program that gives the sum of n numbers using C in leafpad editor."sum1ton.c" is the filename

 ![overleaf sum1ton](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b683e34-7296-4785-889d-fc1b85038656)

 After Compiling C code save ``ctrl+s`` and close the window ``ctrl+w`` 

 Run the program and check the results using commands
 ````
gcc sum1ton.c
./a.out 
````
./a.out is used for result

result :

![c result ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78b285ae-7b20-4409-acd1-4d8e9ebccf8c)

RISC -V Based Lab
----
Now we are compiling the same code in RISCV 
compiling using command ```cat sum1ton.c```

![risc1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e31f14d-e508-4d95-bd6d-167a52d6333a)

For compiling the above C code in RISCV use command 
```
 riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```
Command breakdown : 

``riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc``: This is the cross-compiler for RISC-V architecture targeting 64-bit systems ``riscv64`` and producing ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binaries.

`-O1`:Enables level 1 optimizations, focusing on basic optimizations to improve performance without excessive compile-time or memory usage.

`-mabi=lp64`:Specifies the application binary interface (ABI) for the target.
`lp64` means:
"long" and pointers are 64 bits.
Integer types are kept at 32 bits (e.g., int is 32 bits).
This is the standard ABI for 64-bit RISC-V systems

`-march=rv64i` : Specifies the target architecture.

`-o sum1ton.o`: Specifies the output file's name `sum1ton.o`, which will be the compiled object file.

After this open a new tab and give command as `` riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less``

After compiling in RISC we will get the Assembly language code of it and we will seaarch for main part of the code using ``/main``

and the Assembly language for main function of the code is as :
![risc2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8e2d864-cbe7-44a6-9e9c-eb020d99e489)

In this Assembly language code there are 11 instructions using -O1 

Now we will check number of instructions using ``-Ofast``

![main o-fast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae45d301-d528-4fd0-894f-142e972ab70b)

Even in this case there are 11 instructions 

What is the Difference between -O1 and -Ofast ?
-
The `-O1` and `-Ofast` options in the context of compiling C code with RISC-V (or any GCC-compatible compiler) control the level and type of optimizations applied during the compilation process

In the case of `-O1` it  focus  A moderate level of optimization that aims to improve code performance while keeping compilation times and memory usage reasonable.

In the case of `-Ofast` it focus  Aggressively optimizes for maximum performance, often at the expense of strict adherence to the language standard and longer compilation times.
